      development is only supported for WiFi connections between computer and Android device.)</li>
    <li>IDE: No</li>
    <li>Software to be installed:App Inventor Setup software package</li>
    <li>Advantages:It is very less time-consuming, you can develop an App in less than one hour.
        It helps in promoting creativity through the blocks and eliminate annoying factors of failure.
        The Apps build in this inventor can be easily shared.It is ideal for teaching perspectives. 
        One can use it to teach the students to start with the very basics.</li>
    <li>Disadvantages:Limited UIs,Limited Access to the device,Limited Access to Web,No polymorphic components,
        Limited access to the Android Market</li>
    <li>Language availability:English, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Dutch, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese,
        Russian, Swedish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese</li>
    <li>Uploading and Selling an App: No need to pay license fee to upload the apps.</li>
    <li>Third-party emulator which can be linked to the tool:
        Genymotion ----MIT’s App Inventor setup package does not include the Genymotion emulator, because MIT does
      not have permission to distribute it.   But you can download and install Genymotion on your own, after
      registering for a free license (free for personal use).   Unfortunately, this needs to be done individually  
      for each computer, which makes it awkward for classroom use, and Genymotion does not provide free educational 
      use licenses.  Once Genymotion is installed, you’ll see a gain in speed and also flexibility, since you can 
      configure the emulator to provide multiple screen sizes and form factors using different AVDs (Android Virtual Devices).</li>
    <li>Market Share: less than 1%</li>
    <li>Number of apps available:12 million</li>
    <li>Number of users:4 million registered usres</li>
